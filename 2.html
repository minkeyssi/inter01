  <p><u>Interior</u> design is <strong>the art and science</strong> of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px">An interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.</p>
  <h3 style="margin-top:50px">History</h3>
  <p>In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.</p>
  <p>The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes.</p>
  <p>The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of interior decorator, a term commonly used in the US; the term is less common in the UK, where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.</p>
